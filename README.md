# 🔘 Silver Connect | Elite Care Terminal

**Silver Connect** is a premium, production-ready frontend terminal for a secure caregiving ecosystem. It bridges the gap between families and verified healthcare professionals through a refined, role-based digital registry.

This isn’t just a dashboard—it’s a **controlled-access registry** built with intent.

## 🌟 The Vision
Healthcare platforms shouldn't feel cold or cluttered. Silver Connect uses a **Dossier-style design**, combining deep slate tones and subtle gold accents with fluid motion to create a calm, trustworthy experience. The UI adapts dynamically based on user clearance—because in caregiving, trust is earned.



## 🛠 Core Features

- **Secure Fetch Layer:** A global `secureFetch` wrapper that automates JWT injection and monitors session health on every request.
- **Session Protection:** Immediate local state purging and gateway redirection upon any unauthorized signal.
- **RBAC (Role-Based Access Control):** The interface morphs based on your clearance:
  - **Admin:** The Audit & Control Terminal.
  - **Helper:** Specialist Dossier Management.
  - **Client:** Deployment & Booking Hub.

### 🎨 Design Philosophy
- **Next.js 15 (App Router):** High-performance routing and modern architecture.
- **Elite Aesthetic:** A custom Tailwind theme focused on high-contrast typography and intentional spacing.
